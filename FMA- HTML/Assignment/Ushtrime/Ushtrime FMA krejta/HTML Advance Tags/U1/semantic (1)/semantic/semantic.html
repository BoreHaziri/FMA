                <h2>Earliest Inhabitants</h2>
                <p>The earliest known inhabitants of the area lived around <i>9200 BC,</i> based on evidence found throughout the area and especially at the much-studied <b>Gault Archeological Site,</b><i> north of the city.</i></p>

                <h2>Native People</h2>
                <p>When Europeans arrived, the area was inhabited by the <b>Tonkawa</b> tribe. <b>Comanches and Lipan Apaches</b> also traveled in the region. Though they came into contact with <i>Spanish</i> explorers and missions, few settlements were established for several centuries.</p>
